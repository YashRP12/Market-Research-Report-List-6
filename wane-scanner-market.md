<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wane Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Both Side Scan</li><li>Single Side Scan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wane scanners are used in lumber processing to assess the quality and dimensions of wood. The market can be categorized into two types: both side scan and single side scan. Both side scan systems analyze both surfaces of the timber simultaneously, providing a comprehensive view of defects and characteristics. In contrast, single side scan systems focus on one side only, which may limit the assessment but is often more cost-effective. Both types play crucial roles in optimizing lumber quality and production efficiency.</p></p>
