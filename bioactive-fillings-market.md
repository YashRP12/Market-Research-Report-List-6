<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioactive Fillings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fillings</li><li>Indirect Fillings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioactive fillings market is divided mainly into two types: direct and indirect fillings. Direct fillings involve placing the bioactive material directly into a cavity, allowing for immediate restoration and bonding with the surrounding tooth structure. Indirect fillings, on the other hand, are pre-fabricated outside the mouth, typically using materials like ceramics or composites, which are then bonded to the tooth after customization. Both types aim to enhance tooth function and promote healing while minimizing secondary caries.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Bioactive Fillings Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gold Fillings</li><li>Porcelain Fillings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioactive fillings market encompasses gold and porcelain fillings, widely used in restorative dentistry. Gold fillings are revered for their durability and biocompatibility, often preferred for dental restorations in posterior teeth due to their strength. Porcelain fillings, on the other hand, offer aesthetic advantages as they closely mimic natural tooth color, making them ideal for visible areas. Both types enhance dental health, are resistant to wear, and promote bonding with tooth structure, making them valuable in contemporary dental care.</p></p>
