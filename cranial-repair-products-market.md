<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Repair Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Products</li><li>Non-Absorbable Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial repair products market is segmented into absorbable and non-absorbable products. Absorbable products, often designed for short-term support, gradually degrade and are replaced by natural tissue over time, reducing the need for surgical removal. In contrast, non-absorbable products provide long-lasting durability and structural support, remaining in the body indefinitely. Both types serve critical roles in cranial surgeries, addressing issues such as skull fractures or reconstructive needs while tailoring to patient-specific healing processes and medical needs.</p></p>
