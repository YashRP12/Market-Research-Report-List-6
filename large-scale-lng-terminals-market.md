<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large-scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction</li><li>Regasification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Large-scale LNG terminals can be categorized into two main types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals are where natural gas is cooled to -162 degrees Celsius, converting it into LNG for easy transportation and storage. Regasification terminals, on the other hand, reheat the LNG back into its gaseous form before it is distributed for various uses. Both types of terminals play a crucial role in the LNG industry, facilitating the global trade and supply of natural gas.</p></p>
