<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ice Melt Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Ice Melter</li><li>Liquid Ice Melter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ice melt products market is categorized into two primary types: solid ice melters and liquid ice melters. Solid ice melters, typically in the form of granules or pellets, are dispersed over icy surfaces, working gradually to lower the freezing point of ice and facilitate melting. In contrast, liquid ice melters are applied as a solution, providing faster action and more effective penetration through ice layers. Both types serve to enhance safety during winter by promoting traction and preventing hazardous conditions.</p></p>
