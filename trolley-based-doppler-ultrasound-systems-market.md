<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trolley-based Doppler Ultrasound Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directional Doppler</li><li>Non Directional Doppler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Trolley-based Doppler ultrasound systems are classified into two main types: directional and non-directional Doppler. Directional Doppler systems utilize ultrasound waves that can determine the direction of blood flow, providing detailed hemodynamic information vital for diagnosis. In contrast, non-directional Doppler systems measure the speed of blood flow without indicating its direction, making them simpler yet effective for certain applications. Both types are essential in clinical settings for vascular assessment, enabling informed decisions in patient care.</p></p>
