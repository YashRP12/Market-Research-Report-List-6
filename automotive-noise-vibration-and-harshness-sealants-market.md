<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Noise, Vibration, and Harshness Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bonded</li><li>Non-bonded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) Sealants market is divided into two primary types: bonded and non-bonded sealants. Bonded sealants are designed to create a permanent adhesion to substrates, effectively reducing noise and vibration by forming a solid barrier. Non-bonded sealants, on the other hand, provide temporary insulation and can be removed or replaced without damaging the surfaces. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing vehicle comfort and performance by minimizing undesirable noise and vibrations.</p></p>
